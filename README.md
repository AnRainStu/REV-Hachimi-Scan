## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Camera & Computational Photography
* **Hardware ISP Tuning**:
  - Leverages Camera2Interop to inject high-quality capture parameters, ensuring hardware OIS and optimal tone mapping.
* **50MP Multi-Frame Super-Resolution Burst (Experimental)**:
  - Capitalizes on involuntary physiological hand tremor ($0.1 \sim 0.8\text{ px}$ subpixel displacement) across rapid frames, utilizing ORB + RANSAC homography to accumulate polyphase samples onto a $2\times$ canvas ($8160 \times 6144 \approx 50.1\text{MP}$), reconstructing high-frequency optical detail beyond single-frame Nyquist limits.
* **Orientation Awareness & Dynamic UI Rotation**:
  - Fully adaptive rotation across viewfinder controls, automatically normalizing physical pixel orientation and EXIF headers for convenient landscape shooting of wide banners and station signs.

### 2. Edge Detection & Perspective Correction
* **Text Saliency & Wide Aspect Ratio Support**:
  - Integrates a Sobel gradient integral image to rapidly assess internal stroke energy density (Text Saliency), prioritizing text-bearing signs over empty, reflective glass doors in challenging environments.
  - Accommodates wide aspect ratios up to $12:1$ for subway route signs, banners, and long receipts.
* **Interactive Quad Cropping with 2.8x Loupe**:
  - Floating crosshair magnifying glass displays during corner adjustments for pixel-accurate positioning.
  - Quick aspect presets: A4, A3, 4:3, 16:9, 8:7, and freeform Custom, with automatic foreshortening recovery.

### 3. Document Enhancement Filters
* **Retinex Magic Color**:
  - Isolates the L channel in CIE-Lab color space using low-frequency illumination division to neutralize cast shadows and paper creases, paired with dynamic white balancing to preserve colorful highlighter marks and official stamps.
* **Sauvola Adaptive Binarization (B&W Document)**:
  - Accelerated by double-precision integral images for $O(1)$ local dynamic thresholding, removing photocopy background gray without breaking delicate letterforms.
* **Smooth Grayscale**:
  - Balanced contrast stretching tailored for ID cards, pencil sketches, and invoices.

### 4. Privacy & Document Export
* **100% On-Device**: All C++ NDK and OpenCV computations execute strictly locally.
* **Zero Telemetry**: No user accounts, zero analytics or advertising SDKs.
* **Vector PDF & Image Export**: Compiles clean multi-page PDFs using Android's native `PdfDocument` alongside batch JPEG exports.

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Technical Debt

This project was rapidly prototyped through human-AI pair programming. There are recognized architectural compromises and technical debt in the current codebase that are slated for refactoring:

1. **File I/O Serialization Overhead**:
   - The current multi-frame pipeline writes burst frames to temporary JPEGs on disk, decodes them back in C++ via `imread`, processes them, and writes them back. This introduces unnecessary disk wear and re-compression latency. We plan to transition to a zero-copy memory buffer pipeline using `ImageProxy` / `HardwareBuffer`.
2. **Monolithic UI & ViewModel Components**:
   - Files like `CameraScreen` and `CameraViewModel` currently manage multiple concurrent responsibilities (sensor monitoring, CameraX lifecycle, UI animations, and capture coordination). These will be decoupled into single-responsibility UseCases and Controllers.
   - An in-memory StateFlow repository is currently used; a persistent SQLite/Room database is needed to protect unexported batches against process death.
3. **JNI Interface Refinement**:
   - Several JNI methods pass raw pointer handles (`jlong matAddr`) and flat arrays without comprehensive RAII memory management wrappers.

We welcome constructive critiques, issue reports, and community pull requests.
